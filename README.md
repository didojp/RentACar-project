This is my very first Symfony project which demonstrates only the MVC conception of data processing. It does not intend to be beautiful or with well-structured pages because of limited CSS usage.

What is it for?  - A Rent-a-Car service. You have a list of different types and classes vehicles. Pagination is used for indexing the list. On the left side of the screen, you can precisely find your vehicle selecting through preferred transmission type and vehicle class.
To book the desired vehicle you should be registered and logged in user.
To add new car or car functionality you should have Admin or Moderator rights. If it's so- for your convinience admin panel is included.
You can book your car after choosing a time period for rental. If dates are not correct a notice message will appear.
After booking a vehicle, additionally, you can find any extras for your trip. They are in promotion so you can rent it for free by now. 
A few new functionalities soon will be available:
-	You will be able to accept your invoice directly after creating a deal;
-	Mailing and messaging to the administrator and moderator;
-	Blog;
